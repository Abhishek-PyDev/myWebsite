    with the repetition of the first two lines added to fit the melody.     <br><br>

    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,      <br>
    How I wonder what you are!      <br>
    Up above the world so high,     <br>
    Like a diamond in the sky.      <br>
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,      <br>
    How I wonder what you are!      <br><br>
    ****        <br>
    When the blazing sun is gone,       <br><br>
    When he nothing shines upon,        <br>
    Then you show your little light,        <br>
    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.        <br>
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,      <br>
    How I wonder what you are!      <br><br>
    ****        <br> <br>
    Then the traveller in the dark,     <br>
    Thank you for your tiny spark,      <br>
    He could not see which way to go,       <br>
    If you did not twinkle so.      <br>
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,      <br>
    How I wonder what you are!      <br> <br>
    ****        <br> <br>
    In the dark blue sky you keep,      <br>
    And often through my curtains peep,     <br>
    For you never shut your eye,        <br>
    Till the sun is in the sky.     <br>
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,      <br>
    How I wonder what you are!      <br> <br>
    ****        <br> <br>
    As your bright and tiny spark,      <br>
    Lights the traveller in the dark,—      <br>
    Though I know not what you are,     <br>
     Twinkle, twinkle, little star.     <br>
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,      <br>
    How I wonder what you are!      <br>
